Legibility is for the weak. (Not) named after the (fictional) 19th-century typographer John Ambiguous, this font honors his belief that readability is a sin, ~~the same way that empathy is also a sin~~. Why fixate on "hyper-legible" typefaces, when you can guess what you're looking at?

Perfect for low-effort ARGs that involve dissecting the game files into an Excel spreadsheet, John Ambiguous makes every sentence a riddle for your audience. Take it a step further by (not) using it as your e-reader font.

Available in only one weight because I can't figure out variable fonts.
