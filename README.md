Legibility is for the weak. (Not) named after the (fictional) 19th-century typographer John Ambiguous, this font honors his belief that readability is a sin, ~~the same way that empathy is also a sin~~. Why fixate on "hyper-legible" typefaces, when you can guess what you're looking at?

Perfect for low-effort ARGs that involve dissecting the game files into an Excel spreadsheet, John Ambiguous makes every sentence a riddle for your audience. Take it a step further by (not) using it as your e-reader font.

Available in only one weight because I can't figure out variable fonts.

## FAQ

  * Yes, but look at that glorious tofu glyph. (Provided you can read CJK.)
* Is your font in the public domain?
  * Yes, but why would you use it?
* Erm, excuse me, my full legal name is also John Ambiguous, and this font infringes on my rights. I would like you to take this down, or else I'll see you in court.
